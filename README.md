# Helsinki city bike web application using Java, Spring Boot, Docker, MongoDB and Angular 

---------------------
## Description
This web application displays data from journeys made from city bikes in the Helsinki, stations and also offers possibility to add new entries.
This project consists of two parts: Backend using Java, Spring Boot, MongoDB and Frontend using Angular.

The dataset is owned by City Bike Finland and it can be downloaded from the following:
 - https://dev.hsl.fi/citybikes/od-trips-2021/2021-05.csv
 - https://dev.hsl.fi/citybikes/od-trips-2021/2021-06.csv
 - https://dev.hsl.fi/citybikes/od-trips-2021/2021-07.csv

The information about Helsinki Region Transportâ€™s (HSL) city bicycle stations:

## Pre requirements
Pre requirements for starting the application: You need to have Java and maven installed (Java 15 and maven 3.6.3), Docker and ports available: 8181, 8282, 27017.
Also, when running docker-compose and starting the application a connection to the internet is required.

## Installation:

1. To run the application clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/iuliaMos/angular-mongo-example.git`
2. In the main directory  run `mvn -f backend\citybike clean package` (requires Java 15 and maven 3.6.3)
3. In the main directory run `docker-compose up -d` (requires having Docker installed)
   - It will start one network with 3 services: mongo 4.4, backend app and frontend app
   
During the installation will be created 2 Docker images, Backend app image takes several minutes to build but Frontend app image uses Angular and will take about 30 min to download [Node](https://nodejs.org/en).
After docker-compose command finishes it is required to wait several minutes in order tomcat to start and angular app on [ngnix](https://www.nginx.com/).
The backend app is configured to download stations csv and journeys(just 2021-05.csv) on startup. It can take 30 minutes to import one csv journeys data in background. If stations are imported already in DB the app will skip import.
Also, the frontend app can be accessed at: http://localhost:8282 that uses the backend ass soon as the Tomcat starts, but it will show partial data until all journeys are imported.
The home page will display a map([OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/)) with all the stations on the map.
So the build + start up + import could take 1h

## Application details
Frontend app can be accessed at : http://localhost:8282 \
Backend app can be accessed at : http://localhost:8282 \
Frontend app uses only backend application to display the data. The REST API documentation can be found at: http://localhost:8181/swagger-ui/#/main-controller. \
The application contains a menu:
   - Home - displays the map with all station and when you click on the station icon a popup with station name will be shown.
   - Station - displays stations inside a grid. Grid columns are sortable and filterable. Also, it is possible to change grid's page size in the select above. The **Reset filter** button will reset all filters from grid. The **Add new station** button will open a dialog where you can add a new station. The dialog is validated on frontend and on backend. In each entry from grid the **Info** column will display station's info like map with the position, average distances, total number of journeys and top 5 journeys.
   - Journey - displays journeys inside a paginated, sortable and filterable grid. There is possibility to **Reset filters*** and **Add a new journey**. Adding a new journey will not validate station unique key.

Station's info looks like this:

The Application is tested using JUnit and [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/) for Unit Tests and [SpringBootTests](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#features.testing) for Integration Tests.

### Functionalities accomplished and in progress:
- [x] Data is validated before importing from CSV (like ignore journeys with less then 10 sec and with a distance with less than 10 m)
- [x] Each grid is filtered, sorted, paginated in backend
- [x] Add new entity with partial validation
- [x] Single Station view (Info) contains:
  - a map with the position of the station:
  - total number fo journeys (from the station and at the station)
  - average distance of a journey(starting from the station and ending at the station)
  - Top 5 most popular return stations for journeys starting from the station
  - Top 5 most popular departure stations for journeys ending at the station
- [x] IT use Embedded MongoDB loading data before each test and cleaning data after each test
- [ ] Missing relation between Journey and Station
- [ ] Adding a new Journey will not validate if the station exists ( this can be accomplished with an inline auto complete list)
- [ ] There is possibility to add more types of filtering per column
- [ ] Using GeoJsonPoint for storing geolocation coordinates instead of Double columns(this can bring new functionalities like: nearest stations from the position on the map)
- [ ] Increase performance of the Mongo DB (like sharding)
- [ ] Angular Lazy-load components
